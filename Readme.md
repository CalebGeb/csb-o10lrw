# Caleb Gebhard's Tone.js Project for DAD 492 Special Topics: Programming for Sound Design

My goal with this project was tro create a basic interactive web instrument that had a synth and a few percussion elements. I accomplished this by using parts of different projects that were completed in class throughout the semester.

Some problems that I came across in this process was figuring out the ways in which these different parts that I had would work together. In some cases this was easy and the parts just worked together in the way that I expected them to. in other cases I had to do a bit of research to find the right solution.

Overall I would say that I successfully met my goals for this project and am generally happy with the outcome. There are a few things I could improve and also a few things that could be improved upon such as the implementation of midi control.
